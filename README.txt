In order to run the Python files, open them and click run. The resulting statistics will come up in the console, and plots of the predictions, test and train data will apear. 

For the matlab files, run the code from the top down if it is sectioned. The commenting and plot titles outline what the outputs are. 

For the AugustFFT and October FFT m-files make sure you have the specturalAnalysis m-file function to be able to run both the Fast Fourier Series and see the plot.
